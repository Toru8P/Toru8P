# Hey, I'm Toru8P. 👋

I build systems that live in containers, think in code, and sometimes mess with images just for fun.  
Mostly working with Go, Python, Java, and Kotlin — in infra-heavy, backend-y, or AI-leaning corners of tech.

I like things that:
- Run in containers without drama 🐳  
- Speak APIs fluently (REST mostly, gRPC is on the radar)  
- Process images, clean up data, or generate something weird and fun  
- Stay up 24/7 without waking me up 🚨

## 🔍 Dev Work & Side Quests

- 🧠 Image processing experiments — GANs, cleanup filters, tagging models
- 📦 Microservice setups for automation and emulation (Go, Kotlin, Java)
- 💻 Dev environments built on Linux with Docker and Portainer
- 🧰 Personal tools/scripts for handling training jobs, containers, and data wrangling

## 🧭 What’s Next?

Trying to keep things low-cost, smart, and fun — experimenting with personal AI tools, tiny training jobs, and self-hosted setups that don’t melt my wallet.
